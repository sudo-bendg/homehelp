# homehelp  

homehelp is a self-hosted file storage solution designed for home servers, providing a google drive-like experience for personal and family use. The goal is to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for storing, accessing, and managing files on a private network.  

## features (planned & in development)  

### **phase 1: basic functionality (google drive clone)**  
- âœ… file upload, download, and organization  
- âœ… user authentication and access control  
- âœ… web-based interface for managing files  
- âœ… local storage with support for basic metadata  

### **phase 2: ai integration for enhanced file management**  
- ðŸ”„ **ai-powered search & tagging** â€“ automatically categorize files using image recognition, text extraction (ocr), and content analysis.  
- ðŸ”„ **document & image processing** â€“ extract metadata and keywords for efficient searching.  
- ðŸ”„ **automated file sorting** â€“ suggest folder structures based on file types and usage patterns.  

## technologies used  
- **backend:** python (flask or fastapi)  
- **frontend:** html, css, javascript (react or vue.js)  
- **database:** sqlite / postgresql / mariadb  
- **ai tools:** tesseract ocr, spacy, openai clip (for tagging and search)  
- **storage:** local filesystem (with potential cloud backup options)  

## usage  
homehelp is designed for personal and family use within a home lab environment. future plans include improving search functionality, optimizing performance, and adding smart file management features.  

## roadmap  
- ðŸš€ **phase 1:** build a functional self-hosted file manager.  
- ðŸ§  **phase 2:** implement ai-driven tagging and search capabilities.  
- ðŸ›  **future improvements:** mobile access, encrypted backups, and multi-user collaboration.

## a crazy notion

### Flask-Java Hybrid Approach

For this project, I am considering a **Flask-Java hybrid approach** to achieve improved performance, scalability, and efficient file handling for frequent backups and large file operations.

- **Flask (Python)**: The Flask application will handle the **web interface**, including user interactions such as uploading, downloading, and organizing files. It will also manage the front-end logic and communicate with the Java backend for file handling.
  
- **Java (Spring Boot)**: Java will be used to handle **file operations** such as uploads, downloads, and managing the file system. Java is chosen for its efficiency and scalability, particularly in handling file I/O operations, thanks to its optimized file handling libraries and performance for backend tasks.

#### Why This Approach?
- **Performance**: Java, especially with Spring Boot, provides high performance for backend operations, making it more efficient for handling large file operations than Python, especially for frequent backups.
- **Scalability**: Javaâ€™s thread management and robust concurrency model allow for better handling of multiple simultaneous file operations, ensuring the application can scale efficiently for demanding tasks.
- **Learning Opportunity**: This hybrid approach provides an opportunity to explore integrating Python for web development with Java for backend file management, allowing me to test my learning ability and optimize the solution for both speed and functionality.
  
In the future, the goal is to integrate **AI-powered features**, such as tagging and categorizing files, which will be handled primarily by Python and can be seamlessly integrated with the Java-based file handling.
